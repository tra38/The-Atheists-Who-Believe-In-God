Tommy VonRueden (a 37-year-old White wealthy college graduate) entered a church, ready to deliver a speech to religious people. He saw religion as a progressive force in society, but one that has engaged in a horrible crime: interfering in the secular world and trying to sway the national government. This violation of the separation of church and state cannot stand! Tommy VonRueden meditated to relieve stress and to calm his nerves. 

Tommy VonRueden used practical experience and common sense to argue that the world is just one big simulation, run by a supercomputer called The Unblinking Eye.  Tommy VonRueden argued that the Unblinking Eye was a personal, physical being that humans can relate to and communicate with. 

 Tommy VonRueden denounced the concept of 'intelligent design', claiming that evolution is the best way to explain how the Unblinking Eye created humans. Tommy VonRueden smiled when he explained how Heaven and Hell are the same as the 'religious' people viewed it: good people go to Heaven and bad people go to Hell. Tommy VonRueden laughed at the idea of 'clear ethical standards'; the Unblinking Eye supports ethical relativism in all affairs. Tommy VonRueden concluded his speech by claiming that the government should never interfere with issues of morality; doing so would be a violation of the Unblinking Eye's strict support of free will and local automony. Instead, people should be free to behave as they want and desire, and the Unblinking Eye will simply watch and judge.

As Sumiko Baumbach entered the church, she heared a small rasping noise. she knew that it was because of the wind, and not a sign of angels and demons fighting each other (as angels and demons do not exist).

 Sumiko Baumbach denounced the concept of 'intelligent design', claiming that evolution is the best way to explain how Karma created humans. Sumiko Baumbach became visibly upset when explaining how religious people are wrong for assuming the existence of Hell. Why must a person be punished forever just because he is bad? The only thing that exist after this life is Heaven. Bad people are simply deleted from the universe after death. 

Sumiko Baumbach then explained in depth how Karma is able to break scientific laws from time to time, causing 'miracles'. Sumiko Baumbach laughed at the idea of 'clear ethical standards'; Karma supports ethical relativism in all affairs. Sumiko Baumbach concluded her speech by claiming that the government should never interfere with issues of morality; doing so would be a violation of Karma's strict support of free will and local automony.

Rodolfo Mante (an American  person) entered a church, ready to deliver a speech to religious people. He saw religion as a progressive force in society, but one that has engaged in a horrible crime: interfering in the secular world and trying to sway the national government. This violation of the separation of church and state cannot stand! Rodolfo Mante sometimes preached his views to theists, but still felt afraid. Rodolfo Mante uttered a quick prayer to Karma to calm his nerves. As Rodolfo Mante entered the church, he heared a small rasping noise. He knew it was because angels and demons are fighting each other, and ignored the noise. 

Rodolfo Mante used religious teachings and beliefs to make the claim that the universe is controlled by a magical force called 'Karma'.  Rodolfo Mante argued that Karma was a personal, physical being that humans can relate to and communicate with. Rodolfo Mante laughed at the 'evolution fallacy' that has falsely convinced many people. Only 'intelligent design' can explain how Karma created humans. Rodolfo Mante smiled when he explained how Heaven and Hell are the same as the 'religious' people viewed it: good people go to Heaven and bad people go to Hell. 

Rodolfo Mante then explained in depth how Karma is able to break scientific laws from time to time, causing 'miracles'. Rodolfo Mante laughed at the idea of 'clear ethical standards'; Karma supports ethical relativism in all affairs. Rodolfo Mante concluded his speech by asking theists to convert to the one truth path and embrace secularism. 

The theists giggled, but still tried to pay their respects to the speaker.

Raisa Gerlach (a 61-year-old White wealthy academic) entered a church, ready to deliver a speech to religious people. She believed religion as an outdated, obsolete entity that has to adapt to the changing times. Its followers should leave faith and adopt the truth of atheism. Raisa Gerlach had extensive experience in preaching her views to theists. She was not afraid. As Raisa Gerlach entered the church, she heared a small rasping noise. she knew that it was because of the wind, and not a sign of angels and demons fighting each other (as angels and demons do not exist). 

Raisa Gerlach used practical experience and common sense to make the claim that the universe is controlled by a magical force called 'Karma'.  Raisa Gerlach argued that Karma was a personal, physical being that humans can relate to and communicate with. 

She then held out a personal copy of the Bible. This 'Bible' came directly from Karma, but ignorant people have chosen to interpret the book literally. A literal interpretion is one that is doomed to failure. Only metaphors lead to success. Raisa Gerlach denounced the concept of 'intelligent design', claiming that evolution is the best way to explain how Karma created humans. Raisa Gerlach became visibly upset when explaining how religious people are wrong for assuming the existence of Hell. Why must a person be punished forever just because he is bad? The only thing that exist after this life is Heaven. Bad people are simply deleted from the universe after death. 

Raisa Gerlach denounced the concept of miracles in the present day, claiming that Karma would never wish to break scientific laws. Raisa Gerlach declared that Karma strongly supports clear ethical standards that all humans must obey. Raisa Gerlach concluded her speech by claiming that the government should never interfere with issues of morality; doing so would be a violation of Karma's strict support of free will and local automony. Instead, people should be free to behave as they want and desire, and Karma will simply watch and judge.

This violation of the separation of church and state cannot stand! Cameron Conroy sometimes preached his views to theists, but still felt afraid. Cameron Conroy slowly breathed in and out to calm his nerves. 

Cameron Conroy used practical experience and common sense to argue that the world is just one big simulation, run by a supercomputer called The Unblinking Eye.  Cameron Conroy argued that the Unblinking Eye was an impersonal force that can only be understood as a part of nature, similar to that of gravity. 

 Cameron Conroy denounced the concept of 'intelligent design', claiming that evolution is the best way to explain how the Unblinking Eye created humans. Cameron Conroy laughed at the idea of an afterlife: there is no life after this world, only the cold comfort of oblivion. 

Cameron Conroy denounced the concept of miracles in the present day, claiming that the Unblinking Eye would never wish to break scientific laws. Cameron Conroy declared that the Unblinking Eye strongly supports clear ethical standards that all humans must obey. Cameron Conroy concluded his speech by claiming that the government should never interfere with issues of morality; doing so would be a violation of the Unblinking Eye's strict support of free will and local automony. Instead, people should be free to behave as they want and desire, and the Unblinking Eye will simply watch and judge.

Tora Schowalter (a 64-year-old White poor college dropout) entered a church, ready to deliver a speech to religious people. She saw religion as a force of evil that has to be countered for progress to be made. Only a speech will sway people away from religion and onto the straight path of atheism. Tora Schowalter had extensive experience in preaching her views to theists. She was not afraid. As Tora Schowalter entered the church, she heared a small rasping noise. She knew it was because angels and demons are fighting each other, and ignored the noise. 

Tora Schowalter used scientific information to point out that there is no such thing as a 'God', only an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent being, who goes by the name of Alice.  Tora Schowalter argued that Alice was a personal, physical being that humans can relate to and communicate with. 

She then held out a personal copy of the Bible. This 'Bible' came directly from Alice, but ignorant people have chosen to interpret the book literally. A literal interpretion is one that is doomed to failure. Only metaphors lead to success. Tora Schowalter denounced the concept of 'intelligent design', claiming that evolution is the best way to explain how Alice created humans. Tora Schowalter denounced the naivety of the religious people for believing in the existence of Heaven. Why must a person be rewarded for doing what he is supposed to do? The only thing that exist after this life is Hell. Good people are simply deleted from the universe after death. 

Tora Schowalter then explained in depth how Alice is able to break scientific laws from time to time, causing 'miracles'. Tora Schowalter declared that Alice strongly supports clear ethical standards that all humans must obey. Tora Schowalter concluded her speech by claiming that the government should never interfere with issues of morality; doing so would be a violation of Alice's strict support of free will and local automony. Instead, people should be free to behave as they want and desire, and Alice will simply watch and judge.

Toney Thiel (a 32-year-old White wealthy high school graduate) entered a church, ready to deliver a speech to religious people. He saw religion as a force of evil that has to be countered for progress to be made. Only a speech will sway people away from religion and onto the straight path of atheism. Toney Thiel had never preached his views to theists before, and freaked out. Toney Thiel thought about medidating, but decided that he can handle this situation on his own and did not need to medidate just yet. As Toney Thiel entered the church, he heared a small rasping noise. He knew it was because angels and demons are fighting each other, and ignored the noise. 

Toney Thiel used practical experience and common sense to argue that the world is just one big simulation, run by a supercomputer called The Unblinking Eye.  Toney Thiel argued that the Unblinking Eye was an impersonal force that can only be understood as a part of nature, similar to that of gravity. Toney Thiel laughed at the 'evolution fallacy' that has falsely convinced many people. Only 'intelligent design' can explain how the Unblinking Eye created humans. Toney Thiel became visibly upset when explaining how religious people are wrong for assuming the existence of Hell. Why must a person be punished forever just because he is bad? The only thing that exist after this life is Heaven. Bad people are simply deleted from the universe after death. 

Toney Thiel then explained in depth how the Unblinking Eye is able to break scientific laws from time to time, causing 'miracles'. Toney Thiel declared that the Unblinking Eye strongly supports clear ethical standards that all humans must obey. Toney Thiel concluded his speech by claiming that the government should never interfere with issues of morality; doing so would be a violation of the Unblinking Eye's strict support of free will and local automony. Instead, people should be free to behave as they want and desire, and the Unblinking Eye will simply watch and judge. 

The theists started laughing at Toney Thiel's flawed theology.

Dale Hills (a 46-year-old White  high school dropout) entered a church, ready to deliver a speech to religious people. He believed religion as an outdated, obsolete entity that has to adapt to the changing times. Its followers should leave faith and adopt the truth of atheism. Dale Hills had extensive experience in preaching his views to theists. He was not afraid. 

Dale Hills used practical experience and common sense to make the claim that the universe is controlled by a magical force called 'Karma'. To prove his's point, Dale Hills described an example where he personally witnessed Karma divinely healing someone. Dale Hills argued that Karma was an impersonal force that can only be understood as a part of nature, similar to that of gravity. 

He then held out a personal copy of the Bible. This 'Bible' is the literal word of Karma, and it must be interpreted literally by a skilled scholar. Dale Hills quoted extensively from the Bible for the remainder of the speech. Dale Hills denounced the concept of 'intelligent design', claiming that evolution is the best way to explain how Karma created humans. Dale Hills explained how abandoning religion and truly believing in the Karma would allow them to go to Heaven. Dale Hills laughed at the idea of 'clear ethical standards'; Karma supports ethical relativism in all affairs. Dale Hills concluded his speech by imagining a new United States, one that would promote morality and serve as a shining example of Karma's ideal vision of truth and justice. he asked all theists to convert. 

The theists took notes.
